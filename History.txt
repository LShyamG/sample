The development of processors, starting from the **first processors** to modern microprocessors like the ARM Cortex-M series, was a **gradual evolution** of ideas, technological advances, and innovations in computing. It wasn’t just one person who came up with all the concepts; it was the collective effort of **many engineers, scientists, and visionaries** over many decades. Here's how the development unfolded and how these initial breakthroughs were achieved:

### 1. **Early Beginnings: The Advent of Computing**
The idea of building machines to perform calculations dates back to the **early 19th century**, long before we had processors as we know them today. Some of the key milestones were:

- **Charles Babbage**: In the 1830s, Charles Babbage conceptualized and designed the **Analytical Engine**, which is considered one of the first designs for a mechanical computer. While it was never built in Babbage’s time, the ideas in the Analytical Engine laid the foundations for modern computing, including the concept of storing and processing data.

- **Alan Turing**: In the 1930s and 1940s, **Alan Turing** developed the concept of the **Turing machine**, which became a fundamental model of computation and algorithmic processing. This work provided the theoretical groundwork for digital computers.

### 2. **The First Computer: ENIAC and Early Digital Computers**
The first **digital computers** were built in the 1940s. For example:
  
- **ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)**, completed in 1945, was one of the first general-purpose programmable digital computers. However, it was not a "processor" as we understand today but rather a large-scale machine made from vacuum tubes.

- The **stored-program concept** (where a machine's program is stored in memory) came from **John von Neumann** in the mid-1940s, and this idea became the foundation for later computer architectures.

### 3. **The Birth of Microprocessors**
The transition to **microprocessors** happened in the early 1970s. Microprocessors are small, integrated circuits that contain all the components of a computer's central processing unit (CPU), including the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), control unit, and registers.

- **Intel 4004 (1971)**: The first **commercial microprocessor**, the **Intel 4004**, was developed by a team led by **Federico Faggin**, **Marcian Hoff**, and others at **Intel**. It was a **4-bit processor** and marked a significant leap forward in computing. 
  - This was groundbreaking because, for the first time, all the essential components of a computer (arithmetic unit, memory, etc.) were integrated into a single chip. 

- **Intel 8008 (1972)**: The **Intel 8008** was one of the first 8-bit processors. This was the first real, programmable processor that allowed for more complex and flexible operations, and it opened the door to early personal computers.

### 4. **How Did They Know What to Do?**
The process of developing the **first processors** involved many challenges, and the engineers and scientists involved often relied on a combination of **existing theoretical knowledge** and **practical experimentation**.

1. **Mathematics and Logic**: 
   - Much of the groundwork was laid by **mathematicians** and **logicians** like **George Boole** (who developed Boolean algebra) and **Claude Shannon** (who applied Boolean algebra to digital circuits). This mathematical theory provided a way to design logical circuits and eventually the architecture of processors.

2. **Trial and Error**:
   - Early engineers were faced with **trial-and-error** processes. In the 1960s and 1970s, many early computer engineers had limited resources and sometimes worked with rudimentary technology. They were also developing the **tools** (like assemblers, compilers, and simulation tools) that we take for granted today.

3. **Practical Engineering**:
   - The development of the first processors also came down to practical engineering and innovation. For instance, **integrating thousands or millions of transistors into a small chip** required new techniques in semiconductor manufacturing, such as **photolithography**, which had not been widely applied before in electronics.

4. **Systems and Component Design**:
   - In the early days, processors were designed as **small-scale integration (SSI)** circuits, meaning each chip had only a few transistors. Later, advances in **large-scale integration (LSI)** and **very large-scale integration (VLSI)** allowed designers to fit **thousands** of transistors on a single chip. These advances were spurred by the growing understanding of **semiconductor physics** and the development of **transistor technology**.

5. **The Development of Instruction Sets**:
   - When engineers like **Federico Faggin** and **Marcian Hoff** developed early microprocessors, they based their designs on **existing architectures** and instruction sets from earlier computing machines. The **Intel 4004**, for example, was based on a **reduced instruction set** to keep things simple and efficient, a concept that would later evolve into what we call **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing)**.

### 5. **Why Did They Succeed?**
The success of these early processors was due to a combination of **theoretical understanding**, **practical experimentation**, and the availability of **new technologies** in materials science (e.g., **silicon chips**, **transistor technology**) and **manufacturing**.

- **Collaborative Effort**: Much of the work done in developing early processors involved **collaboration** between universities, research institutions, and companies like **Intel** and **Texas Instruments**. These companies built upon earlier work done in **electronics**, **telecommunications**, and **military applications**.

- **Experience with Early Computers**: Early computers, while large and expensive, provided valuable insights into how processors should handle data, instructions, and I/O operations. Engineers and designers built on this experience, refining the architecture of processors over time.

### 6. **Modern Processors (like ARM Cortex-M)**
Once the basic principles of microprocessors were established (early on with Intel, AMD, and others), companies like **ARM** came into the picture. ARM revolutionized processor design with **RISC-based architectures** in the 1980s and **simplified instruction sets** aimed at **power efficiency** and **low cost**.

### 7. **How Did They Do All This Without Prior Knowledge?**
- **Learning from the Past**: Many of the first engineers and scientists didn’t have "prior knowledge" of **microprocessors**, but they **learned** from the technology they had and built on the ideas of the **mathematicians** and **physicists** who had worked on **theoretical computing**.
  
- **Inventive Thinking**: Early engineers often relied on **creativity, experimentation, and collaboration**. They learned **through trial and error**, as well as by adapting ideas from other fields (e.g., electrical engineering, physics, mathematics, telecommunications).

### Conclusion:
The creation of the first processors was the result of **years of scientific progress**, **innovation**, and **collaboration**. The people involved didn't have prior knowledge of the exact future path they would take, but they built on **theoretical knowledge**, **practical experience**, and **scientific advancements** to develop what we now recognize as modern computing. These engineers and scientists paved the way for future generations to refine and expand upon their ideas.
